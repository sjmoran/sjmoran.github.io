<h3>ðŸ¤– Meet My Research Chatbot</h3>
<p>
  I built this custom chatbot to let anyone explore insights from over <strong>8,000 Large Language Model research papers</strong>.  
  It runs on a <strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong> pipeline â€” indexing thousands of papers, embedding them for fast semantic search, and serving real-time answers through a lightweight API.
